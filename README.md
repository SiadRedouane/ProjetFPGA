# ProjetFPGA
The project is done with HandelC, it consists of activating the camera on FPGA and compressing each captured image, memorize its pixels, compare each pixel with the previous pixel, and indicate the significant pixels and color them in red or applying a binary display for the current image (applying dilation or erosion by clicking on the cursor of the FPGA).
