# ProjetFPGA
The project is done with HandelC, it consists of activating the camera on FPGA and compressing each captured image, memorize its pixels, compare each pixel with the previous pixel, and indicate the significant pixels (the pixels that change because of the variation of light or movement of objects) and color them in red or by applying a binary display for the current image (applying dilation or erosion by clicking on the cursor of the FPGA).
